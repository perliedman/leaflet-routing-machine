=======================

**This plugin is barely maintained!** It has been a good long while since I had any reason to work with routing or Leaflet, and it does not look like that will change. I do not spend time on maintaining this plugin, and only rarely can I find time to respond to issues. If you want to take over as maintainer, feel free to contact me at per@liedman.net.

Find the way from A to B on a Leaflet map. The plugin supports multiple backends:

* [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) - builtin and used by default (version 5)
* [Mapbox Directions API](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/directions/) - builtin with the class `L.Routing.Mapbox`
* [GraphHopper](https://graphhopper.com/) - through plugin [lrm-graphopper](https://github.com/perliedman/lrm-graphhopper)
* [OpenRoute Service](https://openrouteservice.org/dev/#/api-docs/v2/directions/{profile}/get) - through plugins
  * https://framagit.org/gegeweb/leaflet-routing-machine-openroute/
  * https://github.com/willmorejg/lrm-openrouteservice 
* [Mapzen Valhalla](https://mapzen.com/projects/valhalla/) - through plugin [lrm-valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/lrm-valhalla)
* [TomTom Online Routing API](http://developer.tomtom.com/io-docs) - through plugin [lrm-tomtom](https://github.com/mrohnstock/lrm-tomtom) by [Mathias Rohnstock](https://github.com/mrohnstock)
* Legacy support for OSRM version 4 through plugin [lrm-osrm4](https://github.com/perliedman/lrm-osrm4)
* Esri - through plugin [lrm-esri](https://github.com/jgravois/lrm-esri)

## Features

* Standard Leaflet control, with Leaflet look and feel
* Routing from start to destination, with possibility of via points
* Add, edit and remove waypoints through both address input and using the map
* Multiple language support
* Highly customizable for advanced use
* Customizable look (theming / skins)
* Open Source released under ISC License (more or less equivalent with the MIT license)

**Update 2020-04-06:** Out of the box, Leaflet Routing Machine relies on OSRM's demo server. At this moment, the demo server (which is outside scope of the plugin and outside control of the plugin's author) is [no longer maintained, and its SSL certificate has expired](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/issues/5655). The plugin will not work unless you [configure a routing backend](https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/tutorials/alternative-routers/) yourself. I am sorry to say that, to my knowledge, there is no good default.

## Support and New Features

Leaflet Routing Machine is in many ways already a feature complete routing UI. Most likely, your requirements are already covered and require very little adaptation.

For questions and discussions, you might want to look at [the Leaflet Routing Machine gitter](https://gitter.im/leaflet-routing-machine/Lobby).

## Building

```sh
npm install
```

This requires [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org/), as well as `grunt`.

# Usage

Download [latest release](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-routing-machine/releases), or obtain the latest release via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet-routing-machine@3.2.12/dist/leaflet-routing-machine.css" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet-routing-machine@3.2.12/dist/leaflet-routing-machine.js"></script>
```

or via npm:

```sh
npm install --save leaflet-routing-machine
```

```javascript
var L = require('leaflet');
require('leaflet-routing-machine');

...
```

LRM attaches itself onto `L`.
